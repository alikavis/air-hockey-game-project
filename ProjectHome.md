Description:

In this project we are going to design an air hockey game with some changes on the original version. There will be two players playing the game on the same client, and each player tries to score by hitting the puck into opponent’s goal. Each player can move within given boundaries and the aim is either to score more than the opponent before the time runs out or to beat a given score limit before the opponent does.

Players can move their bars and use the occasional functionalities attained by power ups using some predefined keys on the keyboard and these keys may be changed by the users. Necessary information about the game play will be available in info panel of the game.

There will be randomly placed obstacles on various levels to make the game more challenging as the player progresses through levels. These obstacles will be in different sizes, shapes and properties. Depending on the level, obstacle numbers, sizes and position may vary. In addition, there will be some coins that will appear randomly during the game and the player who collects them will be able to move faster or have a bigger bar temporarily when defending their goals depending on the type of the coin. There may be some tasks during the game, meaning players will be required to collect some items or complete a given objective.

Scores will be kept after each match and highest scores in each level will be visible to users on the High Scores screen which can be accessed from the Main Menu . Players are given the chance to change some visual features of the game such as the colour of the puck, some of the objects and so on.
